    <h1>Elektra</h1>
    <p>
      Elektra Natchios, the daughter of a Greek ambassador, studied the martial arts as an adolescent. While in the US with her father, she began studies in political science at New York's Columbia University. There she met another student, Matthew Murdock, who would later become Daredevil. Murdock revealed to her that he had superhuman senses that compensated for his blindness, and they fell in love.
